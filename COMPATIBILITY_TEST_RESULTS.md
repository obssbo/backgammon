# agent_mcts Compatibility Test Results

## Summary
✅ **agent_mcts.py IS compatible with train.py** (with one fix applied)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Error in agent_mcts.py (line 7)
**Before:**
```python
import Backgammon
```

**After:**
```python
import backgammon as Backgammon
```

**Reason:** The actual file is `backgammon.py` (lowercase). On case-sensitive filesystems (Linux), the uppercase import would fail.

## Compatibility Analysis

### Required Interface
train.py calls the agent module with the following signature:
```python
agent.action(board_copy, dice, player, i=r, train=training)
```

### agent_mcts Implementation
```python
def action(board_copy, dice, player, i=0, **_):
```

✅ **Compatible** - Uses `**_` to accept extra keyword arguments like `train`

### Optional Functions
train.py checks for these optional functions using `hasattr()`:

| Function | In agent_td_lambda | In agent_mcts | Impact |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| `episode_start()` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Safe - train.py checks with hasattr |
| `end_episode()` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Safe - train.py checks with hasattr |
| `save()` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | **Checkpoints won't be saved** |
| `set_eval_mode()` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Safe - MCTS doesn't distinguish eval/train |
| `game_over_update()` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Safe - legacy hook, not critical |

## Usage

### Option 1: Modify train.py directly
Change line 11 in `train.py`:
```python
# From:
import agent_td_lambda as agent

# To:
import agent_mcts as agent
```

### Option 2: Use the provided train_mcts.py
A pre-modified version has been created at `train_mcts.py` with the import already changed.

```bash
python3 train_mcts.py
```

## Important Notes

1. **No checkpoint saving**: agent_mcts doesn't implement `save()`, so training progress won't be saved to disk. Evaluation will still work.

2. **Training parameter ignored**: The `train` parameter passed to `action()` is ignored by agent_mcts. MCTS doesn't learn during self-play like TD-lambda does.

3. **MCTS is evaluation-focused**: Unlike TD-lambda which learns from self-play, MCTS uses a pre-trained neural network for evaluation. The "training" loop will just be running games for evaluation purposes.

4. **Performance**: MCTS with 100 simulations per move will be significantly slower than TD-lambda.

## Test Results

Ran static compatibility test (`test_compatibility.py`):
```
✓ action() found with compatible signature
✓ Imports backgammon (lowercase) correctly
✓ agent_mcts appears compatible with train.py!
```

## Conclusion

Yes, you can change `import agent_td_lambda as agent` to `import agent_mcts as agent` in train.py. The code will run without errors, though checkpoints won't be saved and the MCTS agent won't actually "learn" from the games like TD-lambda does.
